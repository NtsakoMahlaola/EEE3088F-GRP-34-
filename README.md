## MICRO-MOUSE PROJECT
In this project, we are designing a micro-mouse for maze navigation. The project has been compartmentalised into four modules: the processor, motherboard, sensing and power. The processor and motherboard modules have been designed and will be given to us. Our project involves designing and manufacturing the sensor and power modules. More information about these two modules can be found under their respective branches.
