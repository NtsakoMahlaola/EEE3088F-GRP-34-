## SENSOR SUBSYSTEM
This is a sensor subsytem which is effectively the eyes of the micro-mouse robot, it will provide information to the processor to determine whether there is an obstacle in the path of the micro-mouse, both in the front and sides. This subsystem is an integral part of the overall system which contains the processor, motherboard and power subsystems. This subsystem will be designed and manufactured to detect objects, fit onto the pin headers on the motherboard and have switching means to save power when not in operation.
